(how its other attributes explain its survive odds); The transformation logic: 1. Check the \"Survived\" field to determine if the passenger survived or not.\n",
      "2. Analyze the \"Pclass\" field to see if there is any correlation between the passenger's ticket class and their survival.\n",

      "4. Evaluate the \"Age\" field to see if age had any impact on the passenger's likelihood of survival.\n",
      "5. Look at the \"SibSp\" and \"Parch\" fields to see if having siblings, spouses, parents, or children aboard affected the passenger's survival.\n",
      "6. Examine the \"Fare\" field to see if the ticket price paid by the passenger had any influence on their survival.\n",
