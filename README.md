# Datawizz: Synthetic Data Generation Toolkit

Welcome to Datawizz, an open-source Python package that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to define, augment, and transform tabular and textual datasets. Datawizz is designed to simplify and accelerate the process of synthetic data creation, providing developers with a robust toolkit to innovate and expand the boundaries of data science.

## Features
- **Data Definition:** Easily define the structure and schema of your synthetic datasets.
- **Data Augmentation:** Expand your datasets by generating synthetic data that adheres to your defined structure.
- **Data Transformation:** Transform and enhance datasets by utilizing external knowledge for improved quality and insights.
- **Datasource Connectors:** Integrate with various data sources to extract data structures from existing datasets.
- **LLM Agnostic:** Connect to a variety of pre-trained LLMs for flexible data generation.

## Getting Started
1. **Installation:**
```python 
   pip install datawizz
```
2. **Quick Example:**
```python 
  from datawizz import DataDefiner, DataAugmentor, DataTransformer
  
  # Define your data schema
  schema = DataDefiner.define_schema_from_description("Your data description here")
  
  # Generate synthetic data
  synthetic_data = DataAugmentor.generate_data(schema)
  
  # Transform your data
  transformed_data = DataTransformer.enhance_data(synthetic_data)
```
